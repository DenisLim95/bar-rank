Make sure to run mongod server before running this.
You can use mongo as cli for database.

# Things left to implement.
- Add storing and retrieval of actual MP3 file from database (GridFS w/ MongoDB)
	- Make file upload checks (correct media type, etc).
- Build frontend basics to allow for basic features that provide access to APIs.
- Add other libraries needed into the npm install dependencies.
- Figure out correct way to clean up importing of modules (I'm reusing mongoose and express etc all over each file).
